This repository contains the R code to replicate all analyses and figures from our paper:

> Cunningham, E. T., T. L. Staples, I. R. Butler, M. Lepore, H. Markham Summers, G. Roff, and J. M. Pandolfi. 2024. Taxonomic novelty emerges more frequently and independently of functional novelty in historical coral communities. Oikos:e10912.

### reef matrix cores

In this project, we work with historical corals from reef matrix cores. The cores were collected across the east of so-called Australia. These cores constitute a larger *Queensland Quaternary Core Collection* funded by the Australian Research Council and National Environmental Research Program. Thank you very much to Drs Hannah Markham Summers, George Roff, Mauro Lepore, and Ian Butler for their field work and processing.

### acknowledging Country

We studied corals who have lived long lives in Sea Country. Over millennia, they have built incredible underwater places and felt changes to their homes. We pay our respect to the corals, their Sea Country, and the Traditional Custodians across the Reef who are working towards a healthier future on Country.

We acknowledge Mandingalby Yidinji and Gungandji Sea Country (Frankland Islands), Bwgcolman Sea Country (Palm Islands), Woppaburra Sea Country (Keppel Islands), and Butchulla Sea Country (Hervey Bay).

### coding workflow

Open `novel-millennium.Rproj` and run scripts in sequence from `1-data-preparation.R`. 

You can also run any script out of sequence by calling on previous code, such that you could simply open and run `3-figures.R` and create figure outputs.

### any questions?

[Please contact me](mailto:e.cunningham@uqconnect.edu.au?subject=Novel%20millennium%20paper%20enquiry) if you would like to learn more! I am happy to chat about anything, including the raw reef matrix core data that we processed into `sorted-matrices.RDS`.
