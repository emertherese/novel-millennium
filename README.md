### Taxonomic novelty emerges more frequently and independently of functional novelty in historical coral communities

To replicate all analyses and figures, open `novel-millennium.Rproj` and run scripts in sequence from `1-data-preparation.R`. Each script has also been designed to run out of sequence by calling on previous code, such that you could simply open and run `3-figures.R` and create figure outputs.

This project considers historical corals from reef matrix cores. These reef matrix cores constitute a larger "Queensland Quaternary Core Collection", funded by the Australian Research Council and National Environmental Research Program.

The places these corals come from, their Country, and primary researchers are acknowledged below. Please contact me (e.cunningham@uqconnect.edu.au) if you would like to learn more about the raw reef matrix core data that were processed into `sorted-matrices.RDS`. These sorted matrices show coral genus relative abundance aggregated within 20-year time bins, with one matrix per reef matrix core (n = 55).
